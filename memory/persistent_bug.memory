# PERSISTENT BUGS MEMORY
## Currently Known Issues
- No persistent bugs documented yet - this is a fresh start

## Watch Out For (Common Issues)
- Field names with special characters (%, spaces, ?) breaking Prisma
- Bubble API rate limiting during large syncs
- PostgreSQL connection timeouts on Railway
- Schema generation failing on complex data types
- Prisma upsert conflicts on duplicate bubbleId values

## Monitoring Points
- Check field mapping for: "Invoice Date", "1st Payment %", "Commission Paid?"
- Monitor sync status during long-running operations
- Watch for Railway deployment failures on schema changes
- Track memory usage during large table syncs

## Error Patterns to Log
- Prisma schema generation failures
- Bubble API authentication errors
- Database connection drops during sync
- Field type conversion errors
- Missing @map() directives causing DB errors

## Resolution Strategy
- Always log full error context (table, record ID, field name)
- Stop sync immediately on first error - don't continue
- Use Railway logs for debugging, not local console
- Test schema changes with small data sets first
