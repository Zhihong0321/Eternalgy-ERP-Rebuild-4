# SECURITY MEMORY
## Security Constraints
- Single user system - no authentication required
- Railway-only deployment - no local security concerns  
- Environment variables for sensitive data only

## API Security
- Bubble API credentials via Railway environment variables
- PostgreSQL credentials managed by Railway
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- No local credential storage

## Data Protection
- Bubble data is source of truth - read-only access
- No sensitive data transformation or storage beyond mirroring
- PostgreSQL access limited to Railway environment
- No local database copies permitted

## Deployment Security  
- GitHub repository can be public (no secrets in code)
- Railway environment variables for all credentials
- Automatic deployment from GitHub - no manual credential handling
- No localhost endpoints or development servers

## Audit Requirements
- Log all API access attempts
- Track sync operations and data changes
- Monitor for unusual patterns in Bubble API usage
- Railway provides deployment and access logs

## Risk Mitigation
- No local development = no local security risks
- Railway-managed infrastructure reduces attack surface  
- Read-only sync prevents data corruption
- Simple architecture minimizes security complexity

## Compliance Notes
- Data mirroring only - no data transformation
- Bubble remains authoritative source
- Railway infrastructure handles most security concerns
- Minimal custom security implementation needed
