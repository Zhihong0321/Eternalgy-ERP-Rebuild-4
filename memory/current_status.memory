# CURRENT PROJECT STATUS MEMORY
## Last Updated: 2025-08-10

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES
1. **API Discovery Phase**: 100% Complete
   - 7 data types discovered: user, invoice, payment, agent, package, product, category
   - API connectivity confirmed and working
   - Field patterns documented (spaces, special chars, arrays)
   - Rate limits established (~300ms between requests)
   - Sample data captured for all types

2. **Infrastructure Phase**: 100% Complete  
   - Railway deployment working
   - PostgreSQL database available
   - Environment variables identified
   - Production URL: https://eternalgy-erp-retry3-production.up.railway.app
   - Railway Service: eternalgy-erp-retry3
   - PostgreSQL: Available with connection string

## ‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONE: PHASE 1 INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE
- Development environment fully ready
- Multi-session progress tracking system implemented
- All foundation components verified and working

## üìã READY FOR PHASE 2: SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION
1. **Next Priority**: Implement BubbleService for dynamic discovery
2. **Following Step**: Create ultra-simple sync service per PSD specs
3. **Progress Tracking**: PROJECT-PROGRESS.md file created for multi-agent sessions

## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)
1. Set BUBBLE_API_KEY in Railway environment
2. Test Bubble API connection via Railway deployment  
3. Implement ultra-simple sync service following PSD rules
4. Generate Prisma schema from discovered field patterns
5. Apply schema to database
6. Implement upsert logic for data sync
7. Test end-to-end sync on one data type
8. Scale to all 7 data types

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS FROM FAILURE ANALYSIS
- DO NOT create custom field mapping services
- DO NOT add middleware between Bubble and Prisma  
- USE Prisma's @map() for database field names
- FAIL FAST on any errors - no complex retry logic
- ONE data type at a time - no parallel processing
- PRODUCTION TESTING ONLY - no localhost

## üéØ SUCCESS DEFINITION
- All 7 data types syncing from Bubble ‚Üí PostgreSQL
- Zero manual intervention required  
- Reliable repeat syncing capability
- Railway deployment working end-to-end
