# CURRENT PROJECT STATUS MEMORY
## Last Updated: 2025-08-10

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES
1. **Infrastructure Phase**: 100% Complete  
   - Railway deployment working
   - PostgreSQL database available
   - Environment variables set and verified
   - Production URL: https://eternalgy-erp-retry3-production.up.railway.app
   - Railway Service: eternalgy-erp-retry3
   - Multi-session progress tracking implemented

2. **API Discovery & Services Phase**: 100% Complete
   - Dynamic data type discovery implemented (50+ types supported)
   - BubbleService with proper rate limiting (300ms delays)
   - SchemaGenerationService with @map() directives for field names
   - API endpoints: test-connection, discover-types, fetch, analyze
   - Schema generation with toCamelCase() and Prisma compliance
   - All services deployed and tested on Railway

## ‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONE: PHASE 2 SERVICES COMPLETE
- Dynamic discovery working (no hardcoded type counts)
- Schema generation from real Bubble data patterns  
- Complete API surface for data interaction
- UDLS.md created for mandatory logging requirements
- All foundation services ready for sync implementation

## ‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONE: PHASE 3 SYNC IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- UDLS Logger Service implemented with full compliance
- DataSyncService with configurable limiter working
- BatchSyncService with global limit (Option A) ready
- HTTP log access endpoints fully functional
- All API endpoints deployed and UDLS-compliant
- Railway deployment configuration updated

## ‚úÖ PHASE 4: CRITICAL PROGRESS - TIMESTAMP CONVERSION FIXED
1. **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Invoice date timestamp conversion now working properly
2. **Issue Found**: Field name mapping between camelCase and @map() directives  
3. **Next Fix**: Align database field names with Prisma schema @map() usage
4. **Status**: Very close to working end-to-end sync

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS FROM FAILURE ANALYSIS
- DO NOT create custom field mapping services
- DO NOT add middleware between Bubble and Prisma  
- USE Prisma's @map() for database field names
- FAIL FAST on any errors - no complex retry logic
- ONE data type at a time - no parallel processing
- PRODUCTION TESTING ONLY - no localhost

## üéØ SUCCESS DEFINITION
- All 7 data types syncing from Bubble ‚Üí PostgreSQL
- Zero manual intervention required  
- Reliable repeat syncing capability
- Railway deployment working end-to-end
