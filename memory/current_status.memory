# CURRENT PROJECT STATUS MEMORY
## Last Updated: 2025-08-10

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES
1. **Infrastructure Phase**: 100% Complete  
   - Railway deployment working
   - PostgreSQL database available
   - Environment variables set and verified
   - Production URL: https://eternalgy-erp-retry3-production.up.railway.app
   - Railway Service: eternalgy-erp-retry3
   - Multi-session progress tracking implemented

2. **API Discovery & Services Phase**: 100% Complete
   - Dynamic data type discovery implemented (50+ types supported)
   - BubbleService with proper rate limiting (300ms delays)
   - SchemaGenerationService with @map() directives for field names
   - API endpoints: test-connection, discover-types, fetch, analyze
   - Schema generation with toCamelCase() and Prisma compliance
   - All services deployed and tested on Railway

## ‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONE: PHASE 2 SERVICES COMPLETE
- Dynamic discovery working (no hardcoded type counts)
- Schema generation from real Bubble data patterns  
- Complete API surface for data interaction
- UDLS.md created for mandatory logging requirements
- All foundation services ready for sync implementation

## üìã READY FOR PHASE 3: SYNC IMPLEMENTATION
1. **Next Priority**: Implement sync service with UDLS logging
2. **Following Step**: Generate and apply Prisma schema to database
3. **Final Step**: End-to-end data sync testing

## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)
1. **Create Logger Service** - UDLS-compliant logging (mandatory before any code)
2. **Implement Sync Service** - Ultra-simple approach with proper logging  
3. **Apply Schema to Database** - Generate and push schema to Railway PostgreSQL
4. **Test End-to-End Sync** - One data type first, then scale to all discovered types
5. **Create Log Endpoints** - HTTP access to runtime and historical logs
6. **Verify Full System** - Complete sync capability across all data types

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS FROM FAILURE ANALYSIS
- DO NOT create custom field mapping services
- DO NOT add middleware between Bubble and Prisma  
- USE Prisma's @map() for database field names
- FAIL FAST on any errors - no complex retry logic
- ONE data type at a time - no parallel processing
- PRODUCTION TESTING ONLY - no localhost

## üéØ SUCCESS DEFINITION
- All 7 data types syncing from Bubble ‚Üí PostgreSQL
- Zero manual intervention required  
- Reliable repeat syncing capability
- Railway deployment working end-to-end
