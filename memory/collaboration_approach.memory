# COLLABORATION APPROACH MEMORY
## Last Updated: 2025-08-10

## ü§ù HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION RULES (CRITICAL)

### 1. Human as Primary Information Source
- User is ALIVE source of critical project information
- User has access to systems/data that AI cannot reach
- When missing info: ASK USER first, don't assume or guess
- User may not code but has domain knowledge and context

### 2. Task Distribution Strategy  
- Some tasks easier for human (Railway dashboard, environment variables)
- Some tasks easier for AI (code generation, file analysis)
- Always clarify WHO should handle each task before proceeding
- Don't duplicate effort or create unnecessary scripts when human can provide direct info

### 3. Project Reset Context - CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
- This is project restart #25+ due to repeated failures
- Current folder deliberately CLEANED of all code
- Only kept: PSD docs, references, summaries, memory files
- All previous implementations DELETED due to failures
- Starting from CLEAN SLATE with lessons learned

### 4. Anti-Rush Protocol (ROOT CAUSE OF 25 FAILURES)
- ‚ùå NEVER rush to action without clarity
- ‚ùå NEVER assume missing information  
- ‚ùå NEVER create test scripts before understanding requirements
- ‚ùå NEVER proceed without explicit confirmation from user

- ‚úÖ ALWAYS ask clarifying questions first
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS confirm approach before coding
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify understanding with user
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS plan thoroughly in Planning Mode

## üìã PLANNING MODE REQUIREMENTS
1. Understand complete context before suggesting actions
2. Ask user for missing critical information
3. Clarify task ownership (human vs AI)
4. Get explicit approval before moving to Implementation Mode
5. Break down complex tasks into clear, confirmed steps

## üö® FAILURE PREVENTION
- Root cause of 25 restarts: Rushing without clarity
- Solution: Thorough planning and human collaboration
- Never assume what user "probably" has or knows
- Always verify before proceeding to implementation

## üö® SPECIFIC FAILURE PATTERN: HARDCODED DATA TYPES (CRITICAL)
- **Restart #24 Root Cause**: AI hardcoded only 7 data types
- **Viral Effect**: Later sessions assumed total = 7, infected entire codebase
- **Butterfly Effect**: Unfixable breaking changes, forced restart #25
- **USER'S ACTUAL DATA**: 52+ data types in Bubble system
- **SOLUTION**: ALWAYS use dynamic discovery, NEVER hardcode counts
- **VERIFICATION**: Discovery endpoint must scan and find ALL available types
