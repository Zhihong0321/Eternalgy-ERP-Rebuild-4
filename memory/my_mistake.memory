# KNOWN MISTAKES MEMORY
## Past Failures (DO NOT REPEAT)
- ❌ Creating FieldMappingService - caused complexity, not needed
- ❌ Modifying BubbleService - reuse existing, don't modify
- ❌ Using JSONB to store raw data - use structured schema instead
- ❌ Adding retry logic - let sync resume manually on failure
- ❌ Processing tables in parallel - do one table at a time
- ❌ Testing locally - all testing must be on Railway
- ❌ Inventing new naming strategies - use toCamelCase() only
- ❌ Assuming field types - sample real data first

## Architecture Mistakes
- ❌ Over-engineering the solution - keep it simple
- ❌ Building frameworks instead of bridges
- ❌ Adding unnecessary middleware layers
- ❌ Complex field collision detection systems

## Development Mistakes  
- ❌ Local development setup attempts
- ❌ Creating localhost endpoints
- ❌ Using local databases for testing
- ❌ Fake/mocked data instead of real API responses

## Sync Logic Mistakes
- ❌ Hardcoding table names instead of dynamic discovery
- ❌ Complex field mapping transformations
- ❌ Parallel processing causing race conditions
- ❌ Not using upsert() for conflict resolution
- ❌ Missing @map() directives for special characters

## Time Management
- Previous attempts took too long due to over-engineering
- Target: less than 6 hours total implementation
- Focus: working bridge, not perfect framework
