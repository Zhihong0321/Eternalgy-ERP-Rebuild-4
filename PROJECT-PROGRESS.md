## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR NEXT AI AGENTS

### Project Context üß†
- This is **restart #25+** due to over-engineering and rushing
- **Root cause of failures**: Rushing without clarity, custom field mapping services
- **Success approach**: Ultra-simple, no middleware, let Prisma handle everything
- **Dynamic discovery**: System must discover ALL 52+ Bubble data types automatically

### Development Rules üö´
- ‚ùå **NO localhost testing** - Railway production only
- ‚ùå **NO custom field mapping services** - Use Prisma @map() directive
- ‚ùå **NO middleware** between Bubble and Prisma
- ‚ùå **NO rushing to implementation** - Plan thoroughly first
- ‚úÖ **ASK USER** for missing information instead of assuming

### Collaboration Approach ü§ù
- **User is primary information source** - Has access to systems AI cannot reach
- **Some tasks easier for human** - Railway dashboard, environment variables
- **Always clarify task ownership** before proceeding
- **Verify understanding** before moving to implementation

### Technical Approach üìê
- **Architecture**: `Bubble.io API ‚Üí Prisma Schema ‚Üí PostgreSQL`
- **Field naming**: `toCamelCase()` for Prisma, `@map("Original Field")` for database
- **Data flow**: One data type at a time, no parallel processing
- **Error handling**: Fail fast, no complex retry logic
