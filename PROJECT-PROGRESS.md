## üîÑ CURRENT STATUS

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **Repository & Git**: All committed and synced to GitHub
2. **Railway Infrastructure**: Connected, environment variables set
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL ready and accessible
4. **Project Structure**: Complete Node.js/Express/Prisma foundation
5. **Dependencies**: All packages installed and verified

### What's Pending ‚è≥
1. **Prisma Schema**: Needs dynamic model generation for discovered Bubble data types
2. **Bubble Service**: Need to implement API connectivity service  
3. **Sync Service**: Core sync logic following PSD ultra-simple approach
4. **API Routes**: Endpoints for discovery, sync, and status monitoring
5. **First Deployment**: Basic server deployment to verify Railway pipeline

### Next Immediate Steps üìã
1. **Test basic deployment** - Deploy current basic server to verify Railway pipeline
2. **Implement BubbleService** - API connectivity and dynamic discovery
3. **Create sync service** - Following exact PSD specifications
4. **Generate Prisma schema** - Dynamic model creation from discovered data types

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR NEXT AI AGENTS

### Project Context üß†
- This is **restart #25+** due to over-engineering and rushing
- **Root cause of failures**: Rushing without clarity, custom field mapping services
- **Success approach**: Ultra-simple, no middleware, let Prisma handle everything
- **Dynamic discovery**: System must discover ALL 52+ Bubble data types automatically

### Development Rules üö´
- ‚ùå **NO localhost testing** - Railway production only
- ‚ùå **NO custom field mapping services** - Use Prisma @map() directive
- ‚ùå **NO middleware** between Bubble and Prisma
- ‚ùå **NO rushing to implementation** - Plan thoroughly first
- ‚úÖ **ASK USER** for missing information instead of assuming

### Collaboration Approach ü§ù
- **User is primary information source** - Has access to systems AI cannot reach
- **Some tasks easier for human** - Railway dashboard, environment variables
- **Always clarify task ownership** before proceeding
- **Verify understanding** before moving to implementation

### Technical Approach üìê
- **Architecture**: `Bubble.io API ‚Üí Prisma Schema ‚Üí PostgreSQL`
- **Field naming**: `toCamelCase()` for Prisma, `@map("Original Field")` for database
- **Data flow**: One data type at a time, no parallel processing
- **Error handling**: Fail fast, no complex retry logic

3. **Verify Bubble API connectivity** - Confirm API key still valid
4. **Review PMP memory files** - Critical instructions and project context
5. **Ask user for current priorities** - Don't assume next steps

### Key Files to Review:
- `PROJECT-PROGRESS.md` (this file) - Current status
- `memory/critical_instruction.memory` - Implementation rules
- `bubble-sync-v3-psd.md` - Failure analysis and architecture 
- `BUBBLE-API-MANUAL.md` - Real API patterns and constraints

### Repository Information:
- **GitHub**: `https://github.com/Zhihong0321/Eternalgy-ERP-Rebuild-4`
